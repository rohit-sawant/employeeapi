This is an Api created using Flask and Python which has data on Employee

Employee table has 6 attributes namely
1.First name
2.Last name
3.Email
4.Age
5.Date Of Birth
6.Mobile No



Direction to use the api:
1. Fetching all values
    The index page will initially display all the employee information

2. Fetching values according to single attribute
    Attribute in the request has to match the attributes from below list 
    ["firstname","lastname","email","age","dob","mobile"] 
    To get the output properly should use attribute as it is, otherwise incorrect attribute would lead to inappropriate data!
    syntax: /employee?attribute_name=value
    Eg: /employee?firstname=Rohit

    Exception: Two same attribute_name cannot be used to filter string.
    eg /employee?firstname=Rohit&firstname=Ojas

3. Fetching values according to multiple attribute
    syntax : /employee?attribute_name=value&attribute_name=value
    Eg: /employee?firstname=Rohit&lastname=Sawant
    this would result all the employee having name firstname as "Rohit" and lastname as "Sawant"

4. Fetching age between two numbers
    syntax : /employee?attribute_name=lower_bound&attribute_name=upperbound
    Eg:/employee?age=10&age=40
    -> this would result all the employee having age between 10 and 40
    You can club age with other attribute
    Exception:
    - Age should be followed by min first and max later
    - only two age attribute_name should be used, greater than 2 would throw an error
        eg: /employee?age=10&age=40&age=60 would cause an error
